This is a collection of NIST SHA-3 entries and a program that can use them.
The program is based on GNU Coreutils's md5sum, with additions made to allow
it to use the SHA-3 entries.

This is possible because each entry is supposed to supply a header file that
maps commonly named structures and functions into specific ones for the hash.
Knowing that, I wrote sha3.c and sha3.h, which use the common SHA-3 API, so
that any SHA-3 entry can be plugged-in.

Before compiling, you must first compile GNU coreutils, which is included
in this package.

The Makefile also has two variables, HASH, SIZE, and TYPE, that specify
which hash, hash size (in bits,) and optimization to use. See the Makefile for
more information on these options.
