This is a collection of NIST SHA-3 entries and a program that can use them.
The program is based on GNU Coreutils's md5sum, with additions made to allow
it to use the SHA-3 entries.

This is possible because each entry is supposed to supply a header file that
maps commonly named structures and functions into specific ones for the hash.
Knowing that, I wrote sha3.c and sha3.h, which use the common SHA-3 API, so
that any SHA-3 entry can be plugged-in.

Before you try this, you must first download and compile a version of GNU
Coreutils; the version I used is 6.12. In the Makefile, change COREUTILS_DIR
to point to where you put Coreutils.

The Makefile also has two variables, HASH, HASH_SIZE, and TYPE, that specify
which hash, hash size (in bits,) and optimization to use. See the Makefile for
more information on these options.
